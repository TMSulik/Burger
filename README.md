# Burger
An exercise incorporating MySQL, Node, Express, and Handlebars.

The assignment was to create a web app following the MVC design pattern: 
a user inputs new data via a controller, which updates the model (the database structure), 
which in turn updates the view that the user sees on the screen. I used Node and MySQL to route the data, 
and used Handlebars to generate the HTML.

The page has a form to order a custom burger of the userâ€™s design. The new burgers are stored 
in the database. They appear in a column on the left. When users click on the burger, they consume it, 
and it moves over to a column on the right.
